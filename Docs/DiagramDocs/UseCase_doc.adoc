The Use Case diagram describes the main functionalities the project will implement. In a nutshell, this program has three main goals :

* To generate one summarised file containing all the information about the courses and the teachers' preferences. This data exists currently in separate files (one per teacher).
* To help the administration to assign teachers to courses via a GUI.
* After the affectation the program can generate two types of export :
** A global assignment file intended to be used by the administration.
** Multiple assignment files representing the assignment of each teacher.
