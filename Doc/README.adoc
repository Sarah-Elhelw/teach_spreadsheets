The Use Case diagram describes the main functionalities the project will implement. In a nutshell, this program has three main goals :

* To generate one summarised file containing all the information about the courses and the teachers' preferences. This data exists currently in separate files (one per teacher).
* To help the administration to assign teachers to courses via a GUI.
* After the affectation the program can generate two types of export :
** A global assignment file intended to be used by the administration.
** Multiple assignment files representing the assignment of each teacher.

== Global context 

image::Images\Sequence_Global_context.PNG[{fullWifth}]

The idea of this diagram is to present a global view of our project. The program starts by receiving all the files link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/AA%20-%20Saisie%20des%20voeux%202016-2017.xls[“AA-Saisie voeux 2016-2017.xls”] already completed by each teacher. *readFilesFromFolder* is the function used to register in a variable of type AggregatedPrefs all the information read in the files “AA-Saisie voeux 2016-2017.ods”. Then, the function *createSummary* writes in a Calc to produce a document similar to https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fichier%20Agrégé.pdf[“Fichier Agrégé.pdf”] given in the subject.This Calc summarizes thus all the files “AA-Saisie voeux 2016-2017.ods” loaded.
Our program, through *writeCoursesInAJsonFile*, will also generate a Json file containing a list of all the courses in the vows files.

If desired by the Admin, our program can end with the generation of the aggregated files. Else, if required by the Admin, our program can continue to help the admin make an assignment. The Assignment process is described in the second sequence diagram (“Sequence_Assignment”), which is refered to in this diagram. If the assignment process took place, the admin will, eventually, send the link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fiche%20de%20service.png[“Fiche de service.ods”] specific to each teacher. 

== Assignment

image::Images\Sequence_Assignment.PNG[{fullWifth}]

The idea of this diagram is to present a focus on the assignment process. We renounced to produce a link:Advice.adoc#Assignment[function] that would make the assignment. Instead, we decided to have our interface helping the Admin to assign the teachers. As long as the Admin is not satisfied, the process repeats itself. Once the Admin satisfied, the program will generate the Calc files summarizing the assignments (link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fiche%20de%20service.png[“Fiche de service.ods”] and link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fichier%20Agrégé.pdf[“Fichier Agrégé.ods”] fully completed).

[[ClassDiag]]
= Class diagrams doc
== Base classes
image::Images\Class_assignment.PNG[{fullWifth}]

*TeacherPrefs* represents the data that we can get from the files that the university gives us. The function *fromOds* reads all the necessary information in the calc link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/AA%20-%20Saisie%20des%20voeux%202016-2017.xls[“AA-Saisie voeux 2016-2017.xls”] to build and return a TeacherPrefs.
The classes *Course*, *Teacher* and *CoursePref* are used in that matter.
*CoursePref* represents preferences from a teacher for a specified course.

*AggregatedPrefs* represents an aggregation of all the TeacherPrefs built in our program.

The *CourseAssignment* class represents the assignment of *only one course* to a number of teachers. The *TeacherAssignment* class stores the number of TD, TP, CM groups assigned to one teacher in the selected course. +

== Gui
image::Images\Class_Gui.PNG[{fullWifth}]

CoursePrefElement lists in Model are used to represent instances of table items in the GUI. The generation of the output files (one per teacher and the summary) are done after the user clicks on the button submit and not in real time because the current writing functions take too long to execute (18s just for the summary file). Besides, if the writing was in real time the program must be able to delete empty files per teacher and some lines in the summary file if necessary.

Here is the process :

Controller initializes the View, the Model and sets its data from Ods files thanks to MultipleOdsPrefReader class.

Then the Controller calls functions in View with the data retrieved from Model to set the table items to show.

Controller registers itself as a listener for the submit button and the clicks on table items.

The listener for submit button triggers the creation of assignment files. The clicks on table items trigger an update of Model and View.

There are functions in Controller supposed to sort the tables by column and to check the validity of the assignments chosen. This may not be up to date as the project is coming to an end.

== Ods Reader classes
image::Images\Class_ODS_Read.PNG[{fullWifth}]

The main goal of these classes is to read information from an link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/AA%20-%20Saisie%20des%20voeux%202016-2017.xls[ods file] and create the corresponding TeacherPrefs object. The classes Course, Teacher and CoursePref that are created by this process are also returned in order to be used for other purposes (like storing in Json format the list of courses available in the input file).
*MultipleOdsPrefReader* reads all the Ods files present in a certain folder via the *readFilesFromFolder* function.

*JsonSerializer*, through *serializeSet*, builds a string Json array of all the courses' information collected from the Ods files. This concept may be link:Advice.adoc#JsonSerializer[generalized].


== Ods Write classes
image::Images\Class_ODS_Write.PNG[{fullWifth}]

We have 2 main writing classes. +

The class *AssignmentPerTeacher* creates a Calc like link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fiche%20de%20service.png[“Fiche de service.png”]. The aim of this document is to summarise all the courses a teacher will teach.

The class *OdsSummarizer* creates a Calc like link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/Fichier%20Agrégé.pdf[“Fichier Agrégé.pdf”]. This document shows all the teachers' preferences for a list of courses. Also, if desired, this class can complete the column Assignment in order to show the possible Assignments our program suggest to do.


You can see what the final result will look like in this files :  link:Documents\AssignmentPerTeacher.ods[“AssignmentPerTeacher.ods”] and link:Documents\OdsSummarizer.ods[“OdsSummarizer.ods”]. +

The functionalities of the package write could be extended to generate link:Advice.adoc#Write[other formats] of summarized files.

The class *OdsHelper* has some useful functionalities that we use in the two other writing classes.


== JsonDeserializer class
image::Images\Class_Json_Deserializer.PNG[{fullWifth}]

The main goal of *JsonDeserializer* is to read courses information, presented in a Json Array format, to build a set of courses. This concept may be link:Advice.adoc#JsonDeserializer[generalized] and adapted to read from RefRof.


*InputVowsFile* deals with the files link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/raw/master/Voeux/AA%20-%20Saisie%20des%20voeux%202016-2017.xls[“AA-Saisie voeux 2016-2017.xls”]. The method *createPersonalizedFiles* creates personalized calc files, by completing the sheet "Emploi du temps", and puts them in a specified directory. This class was not implemented because we renounced working on RefRof to get the teachers' information.

[[GuiDescription]]
= Gui description

The aim of this gui is to simplify the assignment process by displaying all the theachers' preferences and the courses in one place.In addition, the user can do the assignment via this gui.

image::Images\gui.png[{fullWifth}]

When the user runs this program, he will be met with this interface with all the preferences of all the teachers in the left table (If there's a problem with the reading of the input files an error message will shown instead).The user then can choose to move some of these preferences to the middle table by clicking on the item.The items in the middle table
are considered as selected preferences and represents the preferences that the user accepts. After all the wanted preferences are selected, the user can click on the submit button to generate the
assignment files.

Some notes:

* The table on the right shows all the courses.The user can check it to know the maximum number of each group in each course.
* One item in the left or middle concerns exactly one group.For example, if a teacher wants to teach 2 groups of CM for the course Algèbre then there will be two items (one for each group) in the left table at the start of the program.
* The user can undo a selected preference by clicking on the item in the middle table.
* Some mechanism will later be implemented to signal to the user that he can't select a certain preference if the maximum number of group is already reached. For example if we have a course that accepts only 1 group of TD and there is one item on the middle table concerning 1 TD of that course than the user shouldn't be able to select another group of TD for this course from the left table.
* Another mechanism will later be implemented to signal the user when all the groups have a selected teacher.
